Web Design Final Project Spring 2018

* Full disclosure:
* This webpage was designed with Chrome as the main testing
* platform, so other browsers might have unexpected formatting errors
*
* This project was designed to teach us how to incorporate all the aspects
* of website design we had learned from CSCI 145. We learned how to design a
* header with a navigatable toolbar, how to divide the page into informative sections
* that the end user would find engaging, and how to set up the basic file structure
* for a website and its links.
*
* The first three links of the navigation toolbar link to other pages I designed,
* but the last three links do not have pages associated with them. I built the links
* with the potential to come back and build them in the future.
